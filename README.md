# puro - as if stock nvim couldn't get any worse

## features

Many plugins should work out of the box, otherwise try tinkering with their configuration in `lua/packages.lua` and see
if that makes a difference

## motivation

Honestly, I just wanted to waste away behind a computer and subject myself to hours of unparalleled torture.
also cause my previous config (peafowl.nvim) was becoming outdated

## future

- [ ] Reduce overhead during load
- [ ] Haskell Scratchpad
- [ ] Make statusline look better
- [ ] Abandon project
