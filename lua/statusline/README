The code in this directory is a carbon copy of my previous Neovim configuration's statusline which was tailored
for the everforest colorscheme.

As a result, migrating it to another theme may be difficult and tedious. I'm still working on a unified colorscheme
manager so until that's released, you'll have to manually replace every value in `statusline/colors.lua`
